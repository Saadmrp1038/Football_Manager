Football Manager
---------------------

This is my term project for Level-1/Term-II under the course CSE 108: Object Oriented Programming Language Sessional. It is a JavaFX application where football clubs can use their accounts to connect to a local server. A club account is needed to login to server.

After login clubs can see their stats, current team members but most importantly access the market place. Clubs can buy or sell players via the market place.

Java networking is used to handle connection between club accounts and local server. Multiple accounts can be active at the same time. Anytime any change happens all accounts will refresh immediately to reflect the change.

As proper database implementation was not part of project criteria all data was stored in and retreived from text files.
